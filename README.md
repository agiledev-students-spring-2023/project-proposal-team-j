# Project Title

Fashion Finder

# Collaboration

TBD

# What and why?

Whether you have a serious meeting or living in an area where extreme weather conditions are the norm, finding the right choice of clothes to accommodate for different situations can be a massive hassle. Fashion Finder alleviates such headaches by analyzing the preferences submitted by the users and providing apt clothing recommendations to suit the goals and intents of the users. In addition, Fashion Finder will take the user's preferred price range and area into consideration to provide a series of nearby locations where the recommended clothing can be purchased. 

# For whom?

Fashion Finder is tailored towards individuals looking to find the perfect clothing choices to suit their needs. These individuals may range from a businessman looking to buy a formal attire before an important presentation or a new student

# How?

The user will be prompted to answer a series of clothing related survey that will allow Fashion Finder to gauge their goals and needs. These question may range from the preferred price range to the area of the user. Once the survey is complete, Fashion Finder will compile all the provided data to analyze and generate an in-depth list of clothing, along with the nearby locations where such clothing can be purchased in the given price range. 

# Scope

The biggest challenges present in completing this project may be implementing the algorithm for analyzing all the inputted data to generate a list of clothing reflective of the said data and working with the Google Maps API for the locations. Barring that, the implementation of the front-end and the UI of Fashion Finder, such as the generated recommendation page and the survey page, should be fairly straightforward.
